# Homework 1: Mystery Sum

## Instructions

1. Compute the following sum: 1/(n*n), as n goes from 1 to infinity (realistically, stop when there is no change caused by adding the last term).
2. Compute the same sum, except starting from n=infinity down to 1 (start at the minimum representable number in a double)
3. Multiply both results by 6 and take the square root of the sum. Both numbers should be recognizeable.
4. Repeat steps 1-2, implementing the computation using only long doubles, to maximize the precision of the computation
5. Go to writeup.md and answer the questions. Markdown is essentially the same as typing in a texteditor, except there are a couple of fancy formatting symbols like \*, \*\*, #, etc.
